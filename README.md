# MIPS processor simulator
Designed a simulation of non-pipelined and pipelined versions of the MIPS processor for executing given instructions.
Analyzed and compared the performance of pipelined and non-pipelined architectures in terms of clock cycles and execution time.

It is done as a continuation to designing MIPS Assembler. Refer the following link for the Assembler design:
